<p>Welcome, in this article we will discuss on <strong>Choosing the Best USB WiFi Adapter for WiFi Hacking</strong></p><p></p><h4>WiFi Chipset</h4><p>Know before start talking about the Wi-Fi adapter brands that are supported by Kali Linux,  let’s take a look at a more important factor – Wi-Fi chipset which are used in USB Wi-Fi adapters. Wireless chipset is the brain or you can call it as the mind of USB Wi-Fi adapter Which does all the calculations for it. It is the Wi-Fi chipset that determines whether the USB Wi-Fi adapter is good or bad. The brand is irrelevant. It is the chipset inside the USB Wi-Fi adapter that we should take care of. There is a lot of chipset that is supported by Kali Linux which can be used for performing various packet injection and other attack. The best one which is used by most of Wi-Fi pentesters is –</p><h4>Atheros  AR9271</h4><p>This chipset support packet injection monitor mode and master mode which allows this to be used as an access point to create fake hotspot for Evil twin attack. The only  problem with this chipset equal only support 2.4 gigahertz frequency only.</p><h4>TP-Link N150 TL-WN722N</h4><p>If you are a beginner and you are getting started with Wi-Fi penetration testing then probably this is the best WiFi adapter for you.  this is small compact but still it can capture WiFi packets from a good distance. you can use it to perform various injection attacks and capture handshake. This one is compatible with Kali Linux and can be used with various aircrack tools.</p><p><img height="245" src="https://i2.wp.com/hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tplink-tl-wn722n.454A5022a-1024.jpg?resize=768%2C526" width="358"></p><h4> </h4><h4>Alfa AWUS036NHA</h4><p>This is a Wi-Fi adaptor which is made by a very famous company the Alpha which is famous for the production of Wi-Fi devices such as USB Wifi adapter, routers, antennas and other network devices.  this is one of the most commonly used Wi-Fi adapter which is compatible with Kali Linux and can be used to perform almost all of the attacks again 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks. It comes with a 9 dBi antenna which is replaceable and can be connected to other antennas with higher power gain.This is one of the best Wifi adapters for Kali Linux.</p><p><img height="304" src="http://hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A1AZ_1_2014110471886098.jpg" width="405"><br></p><p></p><h4>Alfa AWUS036NH</h4><p>Alfa provides the best USB WiFi Adapters for penetration testing. AWUS036NH is the IEEE 802.11b/g/n Wireless USB adapter with 150 Mbps speed This is also compatible with IEEE 802.11b/g wireless devices at 54 Mbps. You can configure AWUS036NH with ad-hoc mode to connect to other 2.4GHz wireless computers, or with Infrastructure mode to connect to a wireless AP or router for accessing to Internet.</p><p><img height="358" src="http://hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/61FpzD5bBVL._SL1325_-1012x1024.jpg" width="354"></p><p>This is also a plug and play adapter that is compatible with most versions of Linux including Kali Linux.</p><p>If price is not an issue for you then this is the best USB WiFi adapter 2018 it could take your hacking skills to a whole new level.  this WiFi adapter have 4 slots for WiFi antenna which will considerably increase the WiFi signal range and you will be able to capture WiFi signals from a very long  distance.</p><p><img height="275" src="http://hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/awus1900_large.jpg" width="340"><br></p><h4> </h4><h4>Alfa AWUS036ACH</h4><p>So what do we do about the 5 GHz frequency  Wi-Fi networks? The answer to this question bring me to the next USB Wi-Fi adaptor which is also supported by Kali Linux from version 2017.2. This one’s support monitor mode packet injection and he is capable of attacking 2.4 GHz as well laugh 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks. The only problem with this is,  this is really so it is not supported by all the Linux distribution and it does not simply apps available as the previous one.</p><p><img height="322" src="http://hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Alfa-AWUS036ACH-AC1200-Powerful-Dual-Band-WiFi-USB-_57-e1505190234451.jpg" width="322"><br></p><h4> </h4><h4>Panda PAU06</h4><p>This one is a light and compact  USB Wi-Fi adaptor which can be directly connected to Kali Linux.  Kali Linux have been supporting this device for more than 2 years.  due to its small size it can fit anywhere and no one will be suspicious.  this one have an external high gain antenna And power management circuits that considerably reduce the power consumption.</p><p><img height="131" src="http://hackersgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/31olrvb-zdL.jpg" width="327"><br></p><h4>Increasing the Range of Your USB WiFi Adapter?</h4><p>Most of the WiFi Routers and USB WiFi Adapter allow you to change the inbuilt antenna. Usually, the inbuilt WiFi adapter antenna that are provided by the manufacturer will be having 5 dbi or 7 dbi or some times upto 9 dbi power gain, which is very low when compared to the currently available antenna. So if your USB WiFi adapter does support an <strong>external antenna</strong>, you can get a higher gain antenna like a 10 dbi or a 28 dbi. That will surely<strong> increase WiFi range.</strong></p><p></p><p>Thank you</p>
